# Sorry! We're currently closed the app down for maintanance.
## What is the app right now?
The app is currently fixing and i'mproving, heres in the future what it can do with only python brain:
- process text uses openCV, EasyOCR and Tessereact.
- process i'mages will be delayed.
- process codes to explain, debuging.
- process user's `TrainModel.txt` to acquire and gather informations to learn.
- do large file reading to debug and short explain.
- can process paragraphs and answer questions, keywords or shorten.
- generates paragraph with creative ideas, learn from paragraphs that user had sent.
## When is it back?
Uhm... actually i don't know but perhaps a few months to a few years. But yeah i made this since i was about 11 but now, this ti'me that i'm typing, i'm already 12. Afterall, this is just about my skills that i used after learning at school.
## Voice Support???
I mean voice support is great but the python's gtts, tts library is not that fast so im trying to make it better.
# CONCLUSION
## I mean after those challenging moments at school when i was grade 7, i still love to make these but... I prefer making games than this. This was apart of my school STEM project and i dont want to terminate this here.
